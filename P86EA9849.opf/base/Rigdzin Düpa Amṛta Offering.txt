↑ Although it is not entirely certain who wrote and compiled this supplementary text, the verses
from the invocation of the First Dodrupchen onwards, up to and including the prayer to
Khyentse Wangpo, were written by the Third Dodrupchen, so the text has been provisionally
attributed to him.↑ In other words, the six negative emotions.↑ Here in this verse there
is a play on the Tibetan word for amṛta, dütsi, which consists of the two words demon (dü)
and elixir (tsi).↑ An epithet for King Trisong Detsen. It is the secret name he received
from Padmasambhava during an empowerment into the Vajradhātu maṇḍala at Chimphu.↑ One of
the sons of King Trisong Detsen.↑ I.e., Dola Jikmé Kalzang↑ I.e., Khenpo Pema Vajra↑ King
Trisong Detsen↑ Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo↑ Ekajaṭī and Maning Nakpo.↑ Tib. Dorje Lekpa↑ The
five Tseringma↑ Literally ‘that which contains the essence of amṛta’.↑ Tulku Dawa Rinpoche
explains that this means that you should receive it reverently with the special mudrā or
hand gesture.
