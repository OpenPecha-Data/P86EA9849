The Prayer for the Wrathful Guru Takhyung Barwa from the Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse
by Namkha Tsewang Chokdrup

gyalwa kunzang tön chok dorjé sem
To the Conqueror Samantabhadra, the supreme teacher Vajrasattva,
gyepa dorjé pal gyi sengé shyab
Prahevajra,1 noble Śrī Siṃha,
mandzu mitra dzana sutra la
Mañjuśrīmitra, and Jñānasūtra,
solwa deb so jinlab wangkur tsol
I pray – bestow blessings and empowerments!

bima pejung tuksé jebang drok
To Vimalamitra, Padmasambhava, the heart-disciples – king, subjects, and companion –
longchen rabjam künkhyen jikme ling
Longchen Rabjam, the omniscient Jigme Lingpa,
kyab kün yongdü tsawé lama la
And my root guru, the embodiment of all refuges,
solwa deb so drol jé lam na tön
I pray – guide me on the path that brings liberation!

gyal kün chizuk orgyen dorjé chang
To Orgyen Dorje Chang, the embodiment of all the conquerors,
dul ké shé du cholwé trogyal kur
Who takes the form of the wild wrathful conqueror for all those opponents difficult to tame,
yong shar drakpo ta khyung kyilkhor lhar
And all the deities arisen in the maṇḍala of the wrathful guru Takhyung,
solwa deb so drebu tob drol tsol
I pray – bestow the fruition of liberation!

rang ngo ma tong nyidzin lé kyi dang
Without discerning one's own essence, the karmic energy of dualistic grasping
natsok yul la pöpé kyen natsok
Produces various conditions for the proliferation of various objects.
nyidzin nyampa chenpor rangdrol né
May dualistic grasping be self-liberated in great equanimity,
lhün gyi drubpé rigdzin chok nyé shok
And may I then obtain the supreme state of the spontaneously accomplished vidyādhara!

Composed by the one who merely appears to be a Dharma practitioner, Namkha Tsewang Chokdrup.
Maṅgalam.
